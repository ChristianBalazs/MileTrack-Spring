# MileTrack-Spring
DFE Spring project


# Welcome to MileTrack project!



## Why are we doing this?
1. To experience the entire Software Development cycle from setting up user stories to delivering a fully functional app
2. Get accustomed with various tools used during the entire software developing cycle.
3. Use all the concepts, tools and learnings presented during the course.
 


## How I expected the challenge to go ?

Expected the challenge to be really difficult, and it has as I constantly has to do research, understand how to use various tools, concepts and operations.
I wasn't expecting to spend so much searching online for potential solutions to  various challenges encountered during the project.

## What went well?

Getting a better understanding of the entire software development cycle, all steps needed to take.
Managing to overcome the entire complexity of the project and deliver to certain good standard considering it is 1st EVER API Project built.

## What didn't go as planned ?

Lots of time spend doing research and learning.
Didn't manage to connect to MySQL, not enough time to do additional research .



## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

Include other features to include all user stories defined at the start of the project.
Connect to MySQL.
